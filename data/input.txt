In the era of online commerce, the Internet has revolutionized the shopping experience, offering unparalleled convenience for consumers. However, this surge in online retail has brought forth an overwhelming abundance of products scattered throughout the digital landscape, encompassing various attributes like brands, pricing, and more. This project aims to simplify the complexity of product discovery and analysis, enabling users to find their desired products efficiently. We offer comprehensive analysis, including pricing, market insights, sentiment analysis, historical trends, and real-time product comparisons. Leveraging advanced data scraping and data science techniques, our goal is to provide users with valuable insights from a vast pool of data, facilitating informed decision-making. This endeavor has profound implications across business, personal, and commercial domains, empowering users to make informed choices based on product availability, pricing, and specific needs. Accomplishing this goal entails advanced data abstraction, cleansing, and optimization methods, supported by a robust architectural framework. Furthermore, we introduce a product analysis page for visual data representation, optimizing search and retrieval techniques. Empirical evaluations underscore the efficiency and accuracy of our machine learning classifiers, primarily focusing on unstructured and heterogeneous product data from the web and e-commerce platforms.
